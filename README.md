![Flyby](docs/usage_images/multitrack_submenu.png)

Flyby is a console based satellite tracking program that can track a
satellite across the sky with an antenna and adjust your radio with
uplink and downlink frequency doppler shift.

Satellite orbit parameters are given as NORAD two-line element sets
(TLEs). You can use any rotator controller and radio supported by hamlib
(http://hamlib.org).
