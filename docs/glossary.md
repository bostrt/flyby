Glossary of terms
=================

This glossary is copied and reformatted from the original predict manpage (author: John A. Magliacane (KD2BD)).

The following terms are frequently used in association with satellite
communications and space technology:

### AOS
Acquisition of Signal - the time at which a ground station first acquires
radio signals from a satellite. Libpredict defines AOS as the time
when the satellite being tracked comes within +/- 0.03 degrees of the
local horizon, although it may have to rise higher than this before
signals are first heard.
### Apogee
Point in a satellite's orbit when the satellite is at its farthest
distance from the earth's surface.
### Anomalistic Period
A satellite orbital parameter specifying the time between successive
perigees.
### Ascending Node
Point in a satellite's orbit when its sub-satellite point crosses the
equator moving south to north.
### Azimuth
The compass direction measured clockwise from true north.  North = 0
degrees, East = 90 degrees, South = 180 degrees, and West = 270 degrees.
### Descending Node
Point in a satellite's orbit when its sub-satellite point crosses the
equator moving north to south.
### Doppler Shift
The motion of a satellite in its orbit around the earth, and in many cases
the rotational motion of the earth itself, causes radio signals generated
by satellites to be received on Earth at frequencies slightly different
than those upon which they were transmitted.
### Elevation
The angle between the local horizon and the position of the satellite. A
satellite that appears directly above a particular location is said to be
located at an elevation of 90 degrees. A satellite located on the horizon
of a particular location is said to be located at an elevation of 0 degrees.
A satellite with an elevation of less than zero is positioned below the
local horizon, and radio communication with a satellite in such a position
is not possible under normal circumstances.
### Footprint
Diameter of the Earth's surface visible from a satellite.  The higher
the satellite's orbital altitude, the greater the footprint, and the
wider the satellite's communications coverage.
### LOS
Loss of Signal - the time at which a ground station loses radio contact
with a satellite. Flyby defines LOS as the time when the satellite
being tracked comes within +/- 0.03 degrees of the local horizon.
### Orbital Phase
An orbital "clock" that describes a satellite's orbital position with
respect to perigee. Orbital Phase may be modulo 256, or modulo 360, and
is sometimes referred to as mean anomaly when speaking of amateur radio
satellites in elliptical orbits, such as the Phase 3 satellites.
Orbital phase is zero at perigee. Often abbreviated as "Phase" in flyby.
### Path Loss
The apparent attenuation a radio signal undergoes as it travels a given
distance. This attenuation is the result of the dispersion radio waves
experience as they propagate between transmitter and receiver using
antennas of finite gain. Free space path loss is technically an
oxymoron since free space is loss free.
### Perigee
Point in a satellite's orbit when the satellite is at its closest
distance to the earth's surface.
### Nodal Period
A satellite orbital parameter specifying the time between successive
ascending nodes.
### Slant Range
The straight line distance between the ground station and the satellite
at a given time. Often abbreviated as "Range" in flyby.
### Sub-Satellite Point
The latitude and longitude specifying the location on the Earth that
is directly below the satellite.
